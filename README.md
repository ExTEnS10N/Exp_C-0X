Experiment of learning c++11
Based on C++ Primer  
  
Add Chapter "Function", Lack of "Pointer that point to function" temporary.  
  
It's happy to see someone actually clone this, i will update as soon as possible if i have spare time.  
  
Almost all experiments were done on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and were inspired by the book《C++ Primer》.  
  
The book is excellent but too thick to read as well as carry, so my learning is so SLOW.
